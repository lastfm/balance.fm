Welcome to the source code distribution of balance ! 

Installation:
-------------

Linux (i386/itanium), FreeBSD, BSD/OS:
	make
	make install

Solaris:
	Uncomment the LIBRARY and INSTALL definitions in the Makefile.
	make
	make install

If you have any problems just change the very simple Makefile to
fit your needs. Shared memory should be enabled on your machine.

For cygwin uncomment the cygwin definitions in the Makefile first.

Have fun...
